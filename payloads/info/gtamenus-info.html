<center><font size="5" color="black"><b>GTA V Mod Menus & Trainer<br><br>
 These self host versions are still being worked on but seem stable.<br>
 They will get updated as needed. </b><br>
_______________________________________________________________</center><br><br>


<b>All Menus will work on either EUR or USA version of GTA on v1.00 This means<br>
that NO update has been installed. If a menu is for a specific version with <br>
specific update, it will state it when you hover over it.</b><br><br>


<b>How to run menus/trainers:</b> <br>

Run Hen once before running the mods . <br> After hen confirms it's running, you MAY have to hold CIRCLE to close window.<br><br>
 Then pick menu or trainer of choice.<br>
<br>After you see the menu notification pop up wait at least 5 seconds to make sure that they have fully loaded into memory.<br>
Now press the PS button on controller and load GTA V.<br><br>

The Lamace and Psych0s versions are a little larger in size so they will take around 30 seconds or more to load.<br>
Be patient, wait for confirmation.<br><br>
